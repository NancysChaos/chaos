# chaos

Hello,

Things in Nancy's world have been chaotic for sometime now. I've tried a few different website applications and without a doubt been disappointed. I found out about Hugo, the creative freedom it offers, and simply had to try it out. From what I have read so far, it is wise to have all your code available if you should need help, and I'm pretty certain that will happen! 

Making the code available means learning about Git and GitHub too. The suggestions in the tutorial are creating a repository, and editing README.md by writing a bit about myself which is found below.

My fascination with websites began around 1995 when I Java, some my first Apple computer, learned a bit of Java, and HTML, and by 2002 was unable to continue. By the time 2007 rolled around, things had drastically changed. I learned about CSS, among other things, and I was able to create and maintain two sites for other people.

By participating in this tutorial I have better understanding of why using GitHub is advantageous!
